# Code Snippets Collection

Welcome to my collection of code snippets! This is where I gather and organize various reusable pieces of code that I've found useful across different projects.

All of my snippets are **type-safe** and written using popular patterns, such as the **Compound Component pattern**, **Props pattern**, **Facade pattern** and ...

Most snippets are built on top of **shadcn/ui** for use inside **React** and **Next.js** projects.

As a solo developer, I don't have the resources to compete with large libraries or scour the entire internet for the absolute best version of every snippet. You may find alternative or even better implementations elsewhere—including many sources listed on my bookmarks page. Still, these are the solutions that have worked well for my own projects, and I hope you find them useful too.
