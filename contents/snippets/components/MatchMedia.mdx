`MatchMedia` is a wrapper component that conditionally renders its children
based on a media query.

It uses a custom [useMediaQuery](/snippets/hooks/useMediaQuery) hook internally to determine whether the
specified media conditions are met.

some components are heavy to render and just hiding them with `display: none`
is not enough, so we use this component to conditionally render the children.
