Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying its content. It helps search engines understand the content of your pages and can enhance how your pages appear in search results.

## Component

The `StructuredDataScript` component provides a type-safe way to add structured data to your Next.js pages using the `schema-dts` package. It follows Next.js 15's recommended approach for implementing structured data.
