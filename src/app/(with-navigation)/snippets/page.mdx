# Code Snippets Collection

Welcome to my personal collection of **code snippets** — a curated library of reusable code patterns, utilities, and components that I frequently use in my development workflow.

## What are these snippets?

These snippets represent the building blocks I've found myself reaching for repeatedly across different projects. Rather than rewriting the same patterns over and over, I've documented and organized them here for quick reference and easy copy-pasting into new projects.

## Why maintain a snippet collection?

**🚀 Faster Development**: Skip the boilerplate and get straight to building features
**🧱 Consistent Patterns**: Maintain consistency across projects with proven solutions
**📚 Knowledge Base**: Document solutions to common problems I've solved before
**🔄 Iterative Improvement**: Refine and optimize patterns over time
**📖 Learning Tool**: Reference implementations that demonstrate best practices

## What you'll find here

### 🪝 **Hooks**

Custom React hooks for common patterns like debouncing values, detecting mobile devices, and managing mounted state.

### 🧩 **Components**

Reusable UI components following modern design systems and accessibility best practices.

### 🛠️ **Utilities**

Helper functions for data manipulation, type safety, and common programming tasks.

### ⚙️ **Configurations**

TypeScript configs, build setups, and other development environment configurations.

### 🏷️ **Types**

TypeScript type definitions for common patterns and API responses.

### 📝 **Notes**

Development notes, patterns, and insights I've gathered along the way.

## How to use these snippets

Each snippet is documented with:

- **Purpose**: What problem it solves
- **Implementation**: Clean, commented code
- **Usage examples**: How to integrate it into your projects
- **Dependencies**: Any required packages or setup

Feel free to copy, modify, and adapt these snippets to fit your specific needs. They're designed to be starting points that you can customize for your particular use case.

_These snippets are constantly evolving as I discover new patterns and refine existing ones. Happy coding! 🎉_
