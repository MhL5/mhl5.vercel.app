The `InputWithIcon` component is a customizable input field that supports icons on either the left or right side. It's built on top of the base `Input` component.

Key features:

- Supports icons on both left and right sides via the `iconXPosition` prop
- Maintains proper spacing and alignment of the icon
- Fully customizable through className props for the container, input, and icon
- Inherits all native input props through `ComponentPropsWithoutRef`

Known issues:

- Changing the container's padding will break the position of the icon
